# Goals of the Business
# Business Model
We plan to utilize the “Freemium” business model for our project, as it is widely regarded as the gold standard when it comes to extending the lifespan of mobile games. We plan to incorporate in-app microtransactions into our product in the form of one-time purchase digital cosmetics between $3-10 per item. Additionally, we intend to offer a secondary one-time purchase item in the form of “boosters”, an in -game upgrade that will greatly accelerate player progress for $1-5 per transaction. Furthermore, we plan to implement optional in-app advertisements with digital rewards offered for players who watch an advertisement in its entirety.
# Feasibility Analysis
The roguelike genre generated an approximate $1.05 billion dollars in revenue in 2023, and is projected to make $1.53 billion in 2030 based on current growth patterns according to data generated by steam. As our game is in the same genre, we believe that it is more than likely for us to find our place in the market by making a game with features we know have been previously successful in existing games.
