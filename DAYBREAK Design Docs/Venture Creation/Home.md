# Goals of the Business
Create and maintain a viable live service model that is self sustaining.

Collect and retain a total of 2000 regular and active players, accumulating roughly $1.00 per user through in game transactions by end of Quarter 2 of 2025. 
# Business Model
We plan to utilize the “Freemium” business model for our project, as it is widely regarded as the gold standard when it comes to extending the lifespan of mobile games. We plan to incorporate in-app microtransactions into our product in the form of one-time purchase digital cosmetics between $3-10 per item. Additionally, we intend to offer a secondary one-time purchase item in the form of “boosters”, an in -game upgrade that will greatly accelerate player progress for $1-5 per transaction. Furthermore, we plan to implement optional in-app advertisements with digital rewards offered for players who watch an advertisement in its entirety.
# Feasibility Analysis
The roguelike genre generated an approximate $1.05 billion dollars in revenue in 2023, and is projected to make $1.53 billion in 2030 based on current growth patterns according to data generated by steam. As our game is in the same genre, we believe that it is more than likely for us to find our place in the market by making a game with features we know have been previously successful in existing games.
# Marketing Plan
We plan to utilize social media to aid us in reaching our audience.  There will be paid advertisements on X, TikTok and YouTube.  These ads will mainly be videos of the trailer and gameplay, showcasing the key points that make us stand out. 

Additionally, there would be social media channels that will post content as well.
## Pricing Strategy
Our game will be free to play in order to generate a user base but include microtransactions for players who wish to use them. The microtransactions will include things such as cosmetics/skins/effects for characters that do not impact the gameplay but can add additional visual appeal for players who wish to buy them.
# Financial Viability
The roguelike market is very young. Currently the market is predicted to climb in value, up to 1.5 billion dollars by 2031. Additionally, Daybreak offers live service elements and social sharing features not present in other already existing games on the market, making it stand out amongst its competition.
