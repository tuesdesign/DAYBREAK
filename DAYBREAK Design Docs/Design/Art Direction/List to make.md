Basic gun Bullet

Enemy Blood Splatter

XP orb pickup

- [x] Enemy Hurt particles - Enemies should have some dark red gloop that flickers white on initial explosion temporarily fly out of them 
- [ ] Enemy Death particles - enemies crumble into ground, could be a bit gloopy but have it also slightly explode away from the center of the enemy (not too much as enemies - will have additional death particle explosions based on if 
- [ ] Player Hurt particles - same thing but maybe just pure white and whatever colour we choose for the final health bar
- [ ] Flame particles on bullet - for when bullet shoots fire, want to apply a material/particle that shows it is flaming, this should also trail a lil
- [ ] Ice particle/effect on bullet - for when the bullet shoots ice/frozen effects I want some icicle effect on it, this should also trail a lil 
- [ ] Flame effect on enemies - for when the enemy is on fire, i want fire particles coming off of the creature
- [ ] Ice effect on enemies - when enemies are frozen i want there to be ice particles on them (as well as an ice block on them but will have to see if that's a particle or model, if you can make a chunky block of ice around a material that would be stunning) 
- [ ] Chrono Gloop on bullets - Think of a slime that is on the bullets, very gloopy and only slightly translucent.  
- [ ] Chrono gloop on enemies- Think of a slime effect on enemies that gloops down toward the ground 
- [ ] Chrono gloop trail - a ground effect of this gloop that enemies can step in.
- [ ] EXP Pick up particles - a simple sparkle effect and pulsing glow effect to make it more obvious that the player is to pick them up
