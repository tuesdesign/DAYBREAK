# DAYBREAK
Daybreak is a survivor-like player's fight against hoards of devouring void entities in a world being erased from all existence. Taking the successful formula of games like Vaimpre Survivors and 20 Minutes Till Dawn, it introduces live service elements, allowing it to evolve. Daybreak focuses on 5-minute gameplay sessions with social sharing features for players to compete with friends for the best daily scores.
