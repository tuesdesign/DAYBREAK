  loreInformation: "(Transcript from squad leader [REDACTED, recounting a stabilizer
    defense operation.) \r\n\n\"We got the alert at 02:14 cycle time. Stabilizer
    47 had gone dark. No warning, no radio chatter\u2014just a full blackout. We
    scrambled within ninety seconds, but by the time we arrived, the site was already
    compromised. They\u2019d cut through our defenses like they knew exactly where
    the gaps were.\" \r\n\n\"Daybreakers had us pinned the moment we touched down.
    I saw our heavy gunner go down before he even got out of the AV. No hesitation.
    No demands. They weren\u2019t there to negotiate. They were there to break the
    loop by any means necessary.\"\n \r\n(Cont'd)"
