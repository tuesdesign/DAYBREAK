  loreInformation: "The Devouring (Event). Widely regarded among the survivors of
    humanity as the end of  time. A topic of much debate, some speculate it to be
    a manifestation of humanity\u2019s  dependence on materiation. Others believe
    it to be the result of extra-dimensional  influence, possibly by another highly
    advanced civilization in a neighboring timeline.  Those on the fringes of the
    tattered fabric of society, those who gather in dark corners and  speak in hushed
    tones, claim it to be the arrival of a malevolent deity, a vengeful god,  returned
    to punish mankind for usurping the natural order. "
