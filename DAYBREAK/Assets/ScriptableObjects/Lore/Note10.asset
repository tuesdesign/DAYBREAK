  loreInformation: "I confronted Officer Rann about it today. She said she didn\u2019t
    know what I was talking about. That\u2019s a lie. I saw it in her eyes\u2014the
    flicker of hesitation. The fear. She knows something, but she\u2019s too scared
    to admit it. FOREFATHER operatives don\u2019t just ignore anomalies. We document.
    We control. But this? This is different. They want this buried. \n\r\nI\u2019m
    leaving tonight. Rann won\u2019t stop me. If she does\u2026 if she tries\u2026
    I hope she understands. I hope she sees what I saw. \n\r\nIf you find this, burn
    it. If you don\u2019t, make sure someone else does. We can\u2019t let them know
    we remember."
