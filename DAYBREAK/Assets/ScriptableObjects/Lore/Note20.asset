  loreInformation: "Day number\u2026 what does it matter? Time is a lie here. We
    don\u2019t get to move forward. We don\u2019t get to heal. We just get to endure.
    \r\n\nMy daughter still cries in her sleep. She doesn\u2019t remember why. Just
    that something was lost. But how do you explain grief when the moment that caused
    it no longer exists? \r\n\nI go to the same job every \"day.\" I repair things
    that will break again. I rebuild things that will be destroyed again. I watch
    the same people walk the same streets, have the same conversations, make the
    same choices. But sometimes\u2014just sometimes\u2014they do something different.
    A word out of place. A hesitation. A look in their eyes that says, wait, haven\u2019t
    we done this before?\n \r\nWe aren\u2019t meant to remember, but we do. Just
    enough to suffer. "
