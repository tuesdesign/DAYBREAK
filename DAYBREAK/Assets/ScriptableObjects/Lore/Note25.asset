  loreInformation: "Mom, \r\nI know you don\u2019t understand why I joined FOREFATHER.
    I barely understand it myself. They told us we were protecting humanity\u2019s
    last stronghold. That outside of this city, there\u2019s nothing left. That the
    loop is the only thing keeping us from oblivion. I believed them. I still want
    to.\n\nBut something\u2019s wrong. I see people asking the same questions over
    and over, like they know something is missing but they can\u2019t quite grasp
    it. I see entire families move into housing blocks that I swear were empty just
    yesterday. I see my own squadmates hesitate when they issue commands, as if they\u2019ve
    given them before. As if they\u2019ve already lived this moment and are just
    going through the motions. \r\n\n(Cont'd)"
