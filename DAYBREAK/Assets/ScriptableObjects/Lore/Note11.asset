  loreInformation: "They\u2019re real. I found them. They were waiting for me. Others
    like me\u2014like us. They\u2019ve seen it too. The fractures in the loop. The
    way the world shifts, even when it shouldn\u2019t. The things FOREFATHER erases.
    They have records. Proof. Logs from before the first loop. Evidence that the
    cycle isn\u2019t what FOREFATHER claims it is.\n\nThey have a plan. \r\n\nI don\u2019t
    know if I\u2019ll live long enough to see it happen, but I believe in them. If
    I\u2019m reset\u2014if this version of me disappears\u2014someone else will take
    my place. \n\nThe cycle will break. \r\n"
