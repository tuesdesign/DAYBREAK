  loreInformation: "I used to think FOREFATHER kept the lights on. Now, I wonder
    if they were always just making sure we couldn\u2019t see each other in the dark.\r\n\nFirst
    came the curfews. Then came the scanners, the random stops, the quiet disappearances.
    A neighbor, then a cousin, then my brother. Gone. They say it's for our safety.
    That dissidents want chaos. But I\u2019ve seen the way soldiers tense when children
    flinch. I\u2019ve heard the whispers about safehouses rising like mushrooms after
    rain. I\u2019ve felt the pull\u2014how the harder they grip us, the more we slip
    away.\r\n\r\nPeople are running, yeah\u2014but not out of fear of rebels. They\u2019re
    running towards them. FOREFATHER would call it treason. \n\nI call it the only
    way out."
