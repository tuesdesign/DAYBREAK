  loreInformation: "Alectrona-5 (Pre-Devouring)  \u25CF Climate: Tidally locked:
    one side of the planet perpetually faces the local sun, while the  other is facing
    outward into space.  \u25CF Land-to-Ocean Ratio: 90:10 (Bodies of water are only
    found in a narrow strip between  the two hemispheres, where the temperature is
    stable enough for life to persist).  \u25CF Notable Features:  \u25CB Half: One
    hemisphere is an inhospitable desert, with lethal temperatures at all  hours.  
    \u25CB And Half: The other hemisphere is a frozen wasteland, with permanent ice-age 
    conditions."
