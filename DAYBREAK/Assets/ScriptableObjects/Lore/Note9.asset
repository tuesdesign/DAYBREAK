  loreInformation: "I should be dead. We should all be dead. \n\r\nThe Devouring
    comes in waves, and yet we persist. The loop resets. We repeat. But what if we
    already lost? What if this isn\u2019t survival\u2014just delay? I saw it. I saw
    what they don\u2019t want us to see. The stabilizer failed, and through the gap,
    there was\u2026 light. A world that shouldn\u2019t exist, but does. \r\n\nThey
    told me I imagined it. \"Loop-induced paranoia.\" That\u2019s what they call
    it. But I am not alone. Others whisper the same doubts. \n\r\nWe have to get
    out. "
