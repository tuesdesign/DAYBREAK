  loreInformation: "The fragments are speaking to us. Not in words, not in voices,
    but in glimpses of what was before. Memories we never lived. Visions of things
    we should not know. \r\n\nSome of us dream of places we\u2019ve never seen. Cities
    with silver spires. Oceans that stretch beyond sight. A sky that isn\u2019t trapped
    in this eternal, dying dusk. Are they echoes of a time before the loop? Or another
    place entirely?\n\nThey want us to forget. FOREFATHER rewrites history, but they
    cannot erase the whispers. The Devouring remembers. It watches. It learns.\n
    \r\nThe stabilizers falter. The walls crack. We do not know when, but we know
    one thing with certainty\u2014  the loop will fail. And when it does, we must
    be ready."
