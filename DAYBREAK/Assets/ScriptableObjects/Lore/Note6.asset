  loreInformation: 'Temporal Stabilizers: These devices resemble metal stakes topped
    with eternally  spinning gyroscopes. When placed in a circle, the stabilizers
    track and preserve the  previous 5 minutes, keeping the interior safely contained
    in a time loop until ideal  external conditions have been met. Previously a medical
    technology designed to keep  critically injured patients alive, the stabilizers
    were not intended for long-term use. The  prospect of reliving the same moments
    in perpetuity has begun to take its toll on the  survivors.\'
