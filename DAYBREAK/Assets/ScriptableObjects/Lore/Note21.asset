  loreInformation: "FOREFATHER tells us we are safe. That the loop is necessary.
    That we should be grateful. But gratitude is hard to muster when you know, deep
    down, that the world outside this city is gone, and all that remains is a dying
    echo. \r\n\nI tried to leave once. Made it all the way to the outer sectors before
    I saw it\u2014the edge of the loop. The way the air folds over itself, the way
    the buildings just stop. I threw a rock past the border. It never landed. It
    just\u2026 vanished. A hole in reality, endlessly waiting. \r\n\nI don\u2019t
    try to leave anymore. I just sit here, drinking the same cup of rationed coffee,
    watching my daughter \"grow up\" in a world that isn\u2019t real. \r\n\nAnd I
    wonder: if we all vanished tomorrow, would we even care? "
