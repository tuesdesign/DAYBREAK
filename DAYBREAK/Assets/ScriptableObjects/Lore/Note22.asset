  loreInformation: "Subject: Contained Insurgency \u2013 Sector 14 \r\nFiled by:
    [REDACTED] \r\nStatus: Resolved. Minimal casualties. \r\n\nAt approximately [REDACTED]
    cycle mark, a group of approximately 30 civilians gathered at the perimeter of
    the stabilizer zone in Sector 14. The crowd was unarmed but agitated. Chanting
    included repeated demands for \"answers\" and accusations that FOREFATHER was
    \"hiding something.\" \r\n\nAttempts at dispersal were met with resistance. Operatives
    deployed crowd control measures per standard protocol; mild chemical irritant
    and high-pressure water hoses. Minor injuries sustained on both sides."
