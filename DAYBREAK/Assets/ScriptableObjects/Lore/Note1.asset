  loreInformation: "Materiation. Allows people to \u201Ccraft\u201D items through
    temporal probing. Once a  replacement to traditional manufacturing practices,
    it has since been outlawed for public  use following the Devouring. Now, materiation
    is a technique exclusively used by  FOREFATHER field operatives to create one-off
    gadgets or weapons that do not (or  could not) exist in our timeline."
