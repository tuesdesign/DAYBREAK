  loreInformation: "And it came to pass in the days of plenty, when Apollo\u2019s
    progeny sought to subdue all need and want, that they did reach into the firmament
    and drew forth a new thing, which they called Materiation. \n\nAnd they said
    among themselves, \"Behold, we have harnessed the hidden things, and what we
    desire, we may now summon from the void, as the gods who sit above the heavens.\"."
