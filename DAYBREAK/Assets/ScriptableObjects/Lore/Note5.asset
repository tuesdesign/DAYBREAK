  loreInformation: "And so it was decreed that the heresy of materiation be named
    unto all but the Forefather, that  the children of Apollo might remember the
    cost of reaching beyond the heavens, and that the order of the world might yet
    be preserved. For unto humanity was given the bounty of the stars, yet not the
    power to shape them; and unto the children of Apollo was given the gift of life,
    yet not to summon it. \n\nAnd this shall be the law, unto the last hour, so sayeth
    the \u2018Father."
