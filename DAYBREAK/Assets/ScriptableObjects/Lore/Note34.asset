  loreInformation: "\"We fought them off. Barely. By the time reinforcements arrived,
    the stabilizer was half-melted slag. The techs say they got to the core, almost
    nuked the whole damn sector. We reset, of course. Repaired the damage. But it
    took longer than usual. I don\u2019t know if that means anything, but\u2026 it
    doesn\u2019t sit right.\" \r\n\n\"We used to think they were just desperate.
    Now I think they know something we don\u2019t.\"\n\n(End Report.)"
