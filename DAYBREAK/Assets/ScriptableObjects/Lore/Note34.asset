  loreInformation: " Coeus-3  \u25CF Climate: Temperate, with localized weather controls
    maintaining comfortable conditions  across most regions.  \u25CF Land-to-Ocean
    Ratio: 95:5 (nearly the entire planet is urbanized, with oceans reduced  to heavily
    managed reservoirs).  \u25CF Notable Features:  \u25CB Temporal Stabilizers:
    A series of temporal barriers surrounding regions of  Coeus-3, created and maintained
    by FOREFATHER to halt the spread of The  Devouring. These fields trap the contents
    in a five-minute repeating cycle, yet life  stubbornly persists within."
