  loreInformation: "(Printed leaflets scattered throughout an abandoned Fracture
    safehouse:)\n\nThey will tell you the world ends outside the loop. They will
    tell you there is no escape. They will tell you we are the last survivors.\n\nThey
    are lying. \r\n\nThe Devouring was never the end. The loop is not salvation.
    It is a prison. FOREFATHER built the walls to keep us in. We have walked beyond
    the borders. We have seen the remains of what they tried to bury. \r\n\nThe cycle
    will break. \r\n\nAnd when it does, we will be free."
