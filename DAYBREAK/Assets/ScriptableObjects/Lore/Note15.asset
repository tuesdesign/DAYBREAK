  loreInformation: Yet the wise among them trembled, and they screamed unto the foolish,
    saying, "This thing is not  for the children of men! For to summon creation from
    the formless deep is to unbind the law set  down since the dawn of time!"  And
    the prophets of old rose from among the people and spoke, saying, "Woe unto you,
    for you  have reached your hand beyond the stars and have seized that which is
    not given. In your hunger,  you have drawn forth life from the shadowed depths,
    and in so doing, you have made the world  to tremble."  And they did declare
    unto them, saying, "This heresy shall be a burden unto all the generations to 
    come, for what was done in haste shall echo forever. The ichor of the lost shall
    rise like smoke  from the chasm, and those who dwell in the spaces between shall
    cry out."
