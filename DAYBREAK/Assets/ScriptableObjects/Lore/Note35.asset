  loreInformation: "Classified Addendum \u2013 Command Directive \r\n(Strictly for
    FOREFATHER high command eyes only. Unauthorized distribution subject to capital
    punishment.) \r\n\nCountermeasures Implemented: \r\n\u25CF Expansion of security
    presence across all stabilizer sites. \r\n\u25CF Immediate termination of any
    FOREFATHER personnel found sympathetic to dissident causes. \r\n\u25CF Increased
    civilian surveillance and suppression of loop retention symptoms among the populace.
    \r\n\u25CF Authorization for controlled loop collapse, should dissident forces
    gain irreversible control of temporal infrastructure. \r\n \r\nCoeus-3 must remain
    intact. The loop must persist. The alternative is annihilation. FOREFATHER is
    the last line of defense, and we do not yield."
