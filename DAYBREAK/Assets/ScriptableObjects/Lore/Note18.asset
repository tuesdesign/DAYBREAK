  loreInformation: "And so it was decreed that the heresy of materiation be named
    unto all but the Forefather, that  the children of Apollo might remember the
    cost of reaching beyond the heavens, and that the  order of the world might yet
    be preserved.  For unto humanity was given the bounty of the stars, yet not the
    power to shape them; and unto  the children of Apollo was given the gift of life,
    yet not to summon it. And this shall be the law,  unto the last hour, so sayeth
    the \u2018Father.   End document  (Investigating operative\u2019s note: This
    is the fourth squatter call we\u2019ve had in 3 \u201Cdays\u201D, if you can 
    call them that anymore. And each call we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve found folks
    like this: religious nutjobs,  spouting crap about how we have to repent or some
    bull. Seems like the Devouring brought all  the wackos outta the woodwork.)"
