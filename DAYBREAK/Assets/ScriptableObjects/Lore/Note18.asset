  loreInformation: "The Devouring isn\u2019t mindless. It\u2019s not just hunger.
    It\u2019s remembering. Reclaiming. Every piece of reality it touches, it absorbs.
    Every piece of us, of our past, of what came before\u2014it's not gone. It\u2019s
    held. Preserved in its depths. And it knows. It knows what was taken. It knows
    what FOREFATHER did. Materiation is a sickness, and it is the cure. \r\n\nI walked
    the edge of the cycle once. Just for a moment. And I saw\u2026 something. A reflection
    of myself, staring back, but not me. Another version. Another loop? Another timeline?
    I don\u2019t know. But I wasn\u2019t supposed to see it. And the moment I did,
    they pulled me back. Reset me. Wiped me clean. \r\n\nBut not completely. Not
    this time. Each loop, I remember a little more."
