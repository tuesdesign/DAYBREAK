  loreInformation: "(Damaged security recording. Audio heavily degraded. Transcript
    reconstructed from surviving segments.) \r\n\n[static]\u2014isn\u2019t right.
    We were meant to be free. We were meant to break the cycle. But they chose control
    over truth. They would rather die in a loop than risk the unknown. \n\nThey think
    they can keep us blind. Keep us spinning in circles, marching to their rhythm.
    But they don\u2019t understand. The loop isn\u2019t a perfect cage. It has cracks,
    and we can slip through them. Sometimes for a second. Sometimes longer. \n\nAnd
    when we do, we see what they don\u2019t want us to see."
