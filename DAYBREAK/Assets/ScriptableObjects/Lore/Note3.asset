  loreInformation: 'The Devouring (Entity). An amorphous mass of jet-black, ethereal
    ichor. Salvaged  recordings have picked up noises akin to fearful whispers and
    pained moans. It is  stronger than you. It is faster than you. There is more
    of it than there is of us. If you  encounter it outside of FOREFATHER territory,
    pray it kills you swiftly. '
