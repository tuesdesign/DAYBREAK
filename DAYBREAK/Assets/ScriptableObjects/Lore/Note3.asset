  loreInformation: "For the Forefather did set forth their commandment from the beginning,
    that no man should bind the stones and stars to his own bidding. And in the halls
    of their wisdom, they decreed the bounds of matter and the seasons of creation,
    saying, \"This is given unto We alone.\"  \n\nYet the children of Apollo hearkened
    not unto the words of the wise, for their eyes were dimmed  by the riches of
    their making. And they did multiply their creations, and by their arts did they
    summon forth spoils from the void, even all that they knew their hands could
    fashion.  "
