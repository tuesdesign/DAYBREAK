  loreInformation: "FOREFATHER is afraid. The cycle is failing. They\u2019re tightening
    their grip. But they can\u2019t stop what\u2019s coming. They can\u2019t stop
    the cracks from spreading. We are remembering. And once we do, we won\u2019t
    be reset again. \r\n\nI heard the voices inside The Devouring. Not whispers,
    not screams\u2014something else. Like echoes of a thousand lives lived and lost.
    They weren\u2019t gone. They weren\u2019t dead. They were waiting. The loop will
    end. Not in fire, not in destruction, but in revelation. When the stabilizers
    fail, when the last walls collapse, we will see what was taken from us. We will
    see what we were meant to be. \n\nIf you\u2019re hearing this\u2014if you still
    remember\u2014then fight. Don\u2019t let them keep you in the loop. Don\u2019t
    let them erase you. The cycle will end. It has to. It\u2019s already begun."
