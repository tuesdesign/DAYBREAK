  loreInformation: "Situation deescalated when a senior operative arrived to address
    the crowd. Official statement provided: \"The loop is a safeguard. It ensures
    your survival. Disrupting it endangers all of us.\" \r\n\nAfter dispersal, multiple
    protesters exhibited signs of distress and disorientation, repeatedly questioning
    past events. Witness reports indicate that several members of the crowd displayed
    symptoms of \"loop retention\"\u2014a phenomenon wherein civilians recall fragments
    of past cycles.\n\nSupplemental Notes: \r\nIndividuals experiencing loop retention
    will be monitored for signs of cognitive degradation or instability. Sector 14\u2019s
    public feeds are to be adjusted to include additional morale programming. Further
    unrest is unlikely but not impossible. Recommend increased patrol presence."
