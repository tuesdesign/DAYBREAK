  loreInformation: "OSOC. Order of Stellar and Omniversal Continuity. The governing
    body of the  known universe, and the many branch timelines therein. Ironically,
    its origins have been  long lost, a result of early mankind\u2019s inferior technology
    and data retention. The  organization\u2019s roots trace back to the infancy
    of humanity, while we were still within the  cradle of Earth. Some claim OSOC
    developed the practice of materiation, others claim  they merely uncovered the
    already-existing technology. Regardless, materiation is  regulated through them
    and them alone."
