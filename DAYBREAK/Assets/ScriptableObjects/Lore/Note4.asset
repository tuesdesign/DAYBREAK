  loreInformation: "But in the millenia to come, a shadow did fall upon the lands,
    and a sickness did spread among them. And from the formless spaces came forth
    a host of specters, who bore the visage of death  and the stain of the deep,
    and they laid waste to the works of men. \n\nAnd on that day, the people wept
    and cried aloud, \"Who shall deliver us from the curse of our  own hands?\" But
    there was none to answer, for the veil between the worlds had been torn asunder,
    and the past and future were drowned with blood."
