  loreInformation: "Unlabeled Scripture:  This collection of handwritten documents
    was retrieved from a damaged FOREFATHER  warehouse. Squatters had taken residence
    inside, in an effort to weather the effects of the  Devouring on the body. FOREFATHER
    operatives were dispatched to relocate the residents.  Begin document  And it
    came to pass in the days of plenty, when Apollo\u2019s progeny sought to subdue
    all need and  want, that they did reach into the firmament and drew forth a new
    thing, which they called  Materiation.  And they said among themselves, \"Behold,
    we have harnessed the hidden things, and what we  desire, we may now summon from
    the void, as the gods who sit above the heavens.\""
